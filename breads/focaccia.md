# Focaccia

This is different from all the other recipes because it's by weight, and does not involve huge proofing times.

- 410g water, 40-43C, with pinch of sugar
- 8g active-dry yeast
- 600g bread flower
- 6g salt
- 30g olive oil for dough (+plenty more for topping)
- 2 sprigs of rosemary
- coarse salt, to taste

1. Combine salt and flour and mix to combine.
2. Proof yeast in sugar water.
3. Add proofed yeast and olive oil to dry mix, and kneed until dough is well-developed.
4. (Optionally, reserve overnight or for up to two days for better-developed flavor.)
5. Let rise 1 hour (1.5 if from fridge); fold, then let rise an additional hour. Preheat oven to 450F.
6. Oil 1/2 sheet pan, and stretch dough with fingertips until fully elastic. Cover with extra tray or damp towel and let rise 20-30min.
7. Dimple with fingertips while stretching to fully cover pan. Add olive oil, chopped rosemary, and salt to taste.
8. Reduce oven to 375; cook for 35 minutes, then in 5min intervals until lightly golden.

(Reheat at 375F)
